# Discrete event systems simulation

This project was an assignment for the Discrete Event Systems class at University of Siena. You can look at the [assignment](./Assignment/progetto_DES_gruppo07.pdf) and the final [report](./Assignment/Project_of_Discrete_Event_Systems.pdf) for more details.

## How to run this code

The main script is `Project_menu.m` - if you run it, a menu will appear that allows you to choose the result of any question (from 2 to 7).

The model (question "1") is inside the report.

For questions "3", "4", "5", "6", "7"  you can also choose to look at the saved result (stored in the folder `Saved_data`) or to start a new simulation, setting the parameters inside the script.
